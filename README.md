# EyeScreen: A Hands-Free Human-Computer Interaction System

**EyeScreen** is a hands-free interface designed to revolutionize the way we interact with computers, leveraging real-time facial tracking and eye-pupil movement to control mouse navigation, browse web pages, and interact with applications without the need for traditional input devices like keyboards or mice.

This project was developed during a hackathon and utilizes cutting-edge technology such as **Google's Mediapipe framework**, **Apple's built-in text-to-speech dictation**, and several **Python modules** to create a truly accessible and innovative user experience.

## Features
- **Head Gesture Control**
- **Eye-Pupil Tracking for Navigation**
- **Auto-Scroll via Smile and Eyebrow Raise**
- **Hands-Free Clicks**
- **Speech-to-Text**
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

Clone the repository:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/lakpa-finju/EyeScreen.git 
cd EyeScreen
```

Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install required Python modules:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup for Apple Dictation (macOS Only)
Ensure that you have Apple's Dictation feature enabled on your macOS device. You can enable this via:

1. System Preferences > Keyboard > Dictation.
2. Enable Dictation and use the default shortcut (double-tap the ctrl key).

## Running the Application
To start the application, run the following:
```
python3 eyeCursorInterface.py 
```
This will launch the EyeScreen interface and begin tracking your facial gestures and eye movements for hands-free control.

Usage Guide
1. Mouse Navigation
    * Move your head to control the mouse cursor.
    * Blink your left eye for a left-click and your right eye for a right-click.

2. Web Page Navigation (Eye-Pupil Movement)
    * Look Left: Go back to the previous webpage.
    * Look Right: Move forward to the next webpage.

3. Auto-Scrolling
    * Smile: Scroll down the webpage or document.
    * Raise Eyebrows: Scroll up.

4. Speech-to-Text
    * Activate Apple’s built-in dictation by opening your mouth a bit larger than your usual speaking position.
